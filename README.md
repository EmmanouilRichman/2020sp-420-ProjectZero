A cliApplication that allows the user to add, delete, and edit UML classes, methods, fields, and relationships in the console window. There is also an optional GUI view. You are also able to save/load files created in the console.

## Prerequisites

 ## Deployment
1. ```Navigate to where the file is located on your computer in the console```
2. ```./gradlew build```
3. ```./gradlew shadow```
4. ```java -jar path/to/jar --cli (for cli) or java -jar path/to/jar (for GUI)``` 

The default option will open up the GUI application. To open the console app, you would need to include a 1 after you specify the path to the file.
